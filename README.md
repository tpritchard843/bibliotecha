This is a simple app I created that allows users to keep track of the books they have read.
The search bar allows users to search for a book via an ISBN number and add it to their list


Optimizations & Refactors:

-- Refactor Fetch API to use async await instead of chained then calls -- performance improvements
-- Implement user profiles as primary storage option instead of local storage
-- Implement React framework
